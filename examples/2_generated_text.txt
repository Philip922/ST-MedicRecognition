Good morning! Please, come in and have a seat.

Morning, Doctor. Thank you.

I’m Dr. Evelyn Harper. Before we begin, may I please confirm some details with you?

Sure.

Great. Your full name?

Jonathan Edward Reyes.

Date of birth?

August 14th, 1986. I’m 38.

Identification number?

Thank you. And what do you do for a living?

I’m an air traffic controller. Stressful job, I guess you could say.

I can imagine. So, what brings you in today?

Well... it’s kind of a mix of things. Lately, I’ve been feeling unusually tired. I mean, I get eight hours of sleep, but I still wake up exhausted. And then there’s the headaches — dull but persistent, mostly in the afternoon. My appetite’s dropped, and I’ve lost about six pounds in the last three weeks without trying.

Fatigue, persistent headaches, weight loss… anything else?

Yeah, I’ve been having some trouble focusing at work. It’s like my brain’s in a fog. And my wife says I’ve been irritable — which I guess I have.

Hmm. And have you noticed any physical changes? Fever, night sweats, or anything unusual?

No fever. But I do wake up sweating sometimes — like, drenched. I thought it was just the summer heat, but the AC’s on all night.

Got it. Let me summarize what you’ve shared. You're experiencing:

Fatigue despite adequate sleep
Persistent dull headaches
Unintentional weight loss (around 6 pounds in 3 weeks)
Decreased appetite
Difficulty concentrating
Increased irritability
Night sweats
Yeah. It’s starting to affect my work and my relationship.

I understand. This combination of symptoms can point to several things — anything from a hormonal imbalance, like thyroid issues, to chronic infections, or even something related to mental health, such as depression or anxiety. I’d also like to rule out any hematological or oncological conditions just to be thorough.

Wow. Okay… that sounds a bit scary.

I know it can feel that way, but the important thing is that you came in. We’re going to run a full blood panel, check your thyroid function, screen for infections, and I’d also recommend a basic cognitive test just to see where things stand. Depending on the results, we can go from there. Does that sound alright?

Yeah… Yeah, that sounds good. I just want to feel like myself again.

We’ll get you there. You're not alone in this.

Thanks. I appreciate it.

You're welcome. Take care of yourself — and we'll talk soon.
